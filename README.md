Blah Blah Balls is a casual creator that allows users to create fun drawings while also playing a modified version of the classic "Brick Breaker" game.

Instructions:
1. Click to release a ball.
2. Move the paddle back and forth across the screen to prevent the ball from falling below the screen. Alternatively, tap "B" on your keyboard to keep all balls in bounds.
3. Keep clicking to release more balls from your new mouse position.
4. When you are done painting, tap the space bar to pause the screen, and tap "S" on your keyboard to save your image.

This system is personally meaningful to me in that it allowed me to explore my creativity and design my first game from scratch. I have always wanted to design games and it was an awesome experience to figure out how I would do so, and how I could manipulate the concept of a game to meet the needs of this assignment. Ultimately, this is my first game and one of my first casual creators, which I am extremely proud of. It is also the first piece of content on my website!

Working on this system challenged me as a computer scientist in many ways. First, I have not worked with Processing before so I really had to learn how to work with by looking through the documentation and examples. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by trying to design and implement a game that could also act as a casual creator. In this sense, I really had to consider how the user would be interacting with my program and come up with a way for my program to give the user fast feedback. I have also never really worked with websites before, so deploying my project to my own website was also an important challenge for me. Moving forward, I am hoping to design more games, that are much smoother, more captivate, and more interactive than this one.

Bugs:
Some balls occasionally fall through the top of the paddle.
The trails can sometimes appear too segmented, and can cause some lag.

Credits:
The Trail's follow() algorithm was copied from the ["Follow 3" example](https://processing.org/examples/follow3.html) in the Processing documentation.

The algorithm for having the each mouse click increase the number of Balls was inspired by the ["Action Only Once on mousePressed" post](https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/action-only-once-on-mousepressed.html) on the Processing forum.

The conditionals to have the balls collide with the paddle were inspired by the ["Brick Breaker" sketch by Raghu Vaidyanathan](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/134612/) on OpenProcessing.

The Ball's move() algorithm was heavily inspired by the ["Bounce" example](https://processing.org/examples/bounce.html) in the Processing documentation.
