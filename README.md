Blah Blah Balls is a casual creator that allows users to create fun drawings while also playing a modified version of the classic "Brick Breaker" game.

## Instructions:
1. Click to release a ball.
2. Move the paddle back and forth across the screen to prevent the ball from falling below the screen. Alternatively, tap "B" on your keyboard to keep all balls in bounds.
3. Keep clicking to release more balls from your new mouse position.
4. When you are done painting, tap the space bar to pause the screen, and tap "S" on your keyboard to save your image.

## Bugs:
- Some balls occasionally fall through the top of the paddle.
- The trails can sometimes appear too segmented, and can cause some lag.

## Credits:
- The Trail's follow() algorithm was copied from the ["Follow 3" example](https://processing.org/examples/follow3.html) in the Processing documentation.
- The algorithm for having the each mouse click increase the number of Balls was inspired by the ["Action Only Once on mousePressed" post](https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/action-only-once-on-mousepressed.html) on the Processing forum.
- The conditionals to have the balls collide with the paddle were inspired by the ["Brick Breaker" sketch by Raghu Vaidyanathan](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/134612/) on OpenProcessing.
- The Ball's move() algorithm was heavily inspired by the ["Bounce" example](https://processing.org/examples/bounce.html) in the Processing documentation.
